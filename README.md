ant-plant-demography
====================
This repository contains the code for the manipulation and analysis of datq used in Bruna E.M., T.J. Izzo, B. D. Inouye, and H. L. Vasconcelos manuscript on ant-plant demography in different habitats.  

This uses data from Bruna et al. 2014. ffect of mutualist partner identity on plant demography. Ecology. Data archived at the Dryad Digital Repository Dryad  Preprint available at PeerJ Preprints (https://peerj.com/preprints/368/)

Still to be added are the scripts for
1) calculating and plotting the stable stage distribution
2) barcharts of the elasticities (parameters and individual stages)
3) LTRE analyses and plots
4) Randomization tests
5) corrections / functions for codes to calclulate sens and elast in Master code
